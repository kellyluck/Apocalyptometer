Yes! It's the Incredible
<H1>Apocalyptometer!</H1>

Because for some reason, the end of the world is kind of at the front of the ol' zeitgeist nowadays. I stumbled on a list of end-of-the-world predictions on Wikipedia and decided to whip this cheery little app up.

There's a second, separate project (Apocalypse Scraper) which actually plucks the data from the wiki page and massages it into a usable JSON file. Or you can just steal mine. Whatevs.

Forthcoming stuffandjunk:
* A random Apocalypse-of-the-Day
* An "on this day" thingy
* Or, barring any serious world-ending on a given day, maybe some trivia. I dunno.
* Open to suggestions /nods toward Issues tab/
